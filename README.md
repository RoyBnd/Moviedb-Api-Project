# Moviedb-Api-Project

In this mini-project I am going to experiment with all three steps in the ETL process:

 * Extract - Extracting movies data from api.themoviedb.org using JupyterNotebook.
 
 * Trasform - Working with the JSON format, which includes:
    1. Arranging the data into a tabular format that includes rows and columns.
    2. Cleaning the data and changing the data type to a uniform and correct configuration for further processing.
    3. Saving the dataframe to a csv file for further processing.
    
 * Load - Creating a connection to a Sql Server database and loading the data into dedicated tables for futher analysis.
 
 TO DO - Continue analyzing the data with SQL Server and presenting insights with visualizations using Tableau and PowerBi.
 
 Hope you find it useful :)
